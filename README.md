# Quakespasm-Spiked's fork by Stradex

This fork is not expected at all to be as stable as Quakespasm-Spiked. It will use lot of code injection and stuff to add some kind of generic new content that should work
in many quake mods and mappacks but not expected to work in all of them. But for sure should work in vanilla quake 1.

Aiming for: Quake 1, Arcane Dimensions and Alkaline.

Expected features to have:
-> Survival Game mode (Limited ammount of lives)
-> Spectator/observe mode
-> Item respawn (Full item respawn and only ammo respawn)
-> Damage factor
-> Fast monsters
